        <h2>How I got started</h2>
        <p>Learning code has been weird for me; I learned in a very backward way. Well, backward now, but I imagine it was the 'norm' when code was first becoming a <em>thing</em>.</p>
        <h3>In the beginning, there was nonsense...</h3>
        <p>A few years ago, I had an idea for building a website where people could send their broken iPhones to a place to get them fixed. I knew how to fix broken iPhones and I thought I could make a better website than the ones that existed. Though I had no idea how to create websites I figured it was pretty easy. Up until this point, I knew more about technology than anyone else in my life which gave me the false confidence that building a website was totally in my abilities.</p>
        <h4>Adobe Muse</h4>
        <p>I began looking for a software to build my website and I came across Adobe Muse. I started building my site in Adobe Muse and it was looking pretty awesome. When I began looking for a way to add eCommerce to the site, I quickly found that there seemed to be no way to do this (this was back in the early days of the software). While I was looking for a way to add eCommerce to my website, I started seeing terms that I did not understand such <em>PHP</em> and <em>Ruby</em>.</p>
        <p>I began researching these terms and found that the explanation of what these things were was some of the most confusing text that I had ever read. I looked for YouTube videos to explain how this stuff worked and found that those videos were not any more helpful than the text that I read. I honestly began to think that no one really knew what they were talking about and that they were using <em>buzz</em> words to sound like they knew that they were saying.</p>
        <h4>Source code</h4>
        <p>I have always been good at math and I always learned new concepts better by backsolving rather than listening to a professor walk a class through each step. 'Realizing' that no one knew what they were talking about with code lead me to think that I could 'backsolve' how code worked. I began looking through the source code of Adobe Muse websites <em>(which in hindsight probably slowed me down because of the bloated code)</em>.</p>
        <p>Since I didn't understand the technical jargon, I would obsess over patterns that I could see in the source code. As I continued to do this, I started understanding how things came together. It wasn't until later that I realized that these patterns were really only relevant to the way that Adobe Muse produces websites.</p>
        <h3>Seeing more clearly</h3>
        <p>The more I began to understand the bloated patterns, the more the technical jargon began to make sense. I started realizing that people on the web did know what they were talking about. Not only that, but there was an enormous community of people that were helping each other build off of each others ideas and abilities. I began looking for a reliable and consistent resource and it didn't take long to find <span style="color:#5fcf80">Treehouse &lt;3</span></p>
